MODIS 1.2.9 (2022-10-08)

features and improvements

  * Aligns runGdal() 'maskValue' with gdalwarp '-srcnodata' option, thereby
    allowing to specify band-specific masking values or ignore intrinsic no-data
    settings altogether (#70)

miscellaneous

  * Removes obsolete Python code initially used for value masking


MODIS 1.2.8 (2022-09-07)

features and improvements

  * Implements a method for function getTile() for signature "sfc" (#127)

bug fixes

  * MODISoptions() remembers length-2+ 'MODISserverOrder' correctly if
    save = TRUE (default)
  * Disables gdalwarp "-multi" option to prevent C stack usage errors when
    running sf::gdal_utils("warp", ...) in verbose mode (see
    https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1994)


MODIS 1.2.7 (2022-09-02)

features and improvements

  * Implements major changes to the download routines, including separate HTTP
    server authentication for LAADS only (i.e. httpauth = 1) to prevent empty
    file download from other servers (#123)

bug fixes

  * Respects metacharacters in Earthdata Login passwords (#105), but does not
    allow for single quotes (i.e. ') when download method is other than curl
    to prevent from "sh: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string" errors

miscellaneous

  * Updates built-in product data:
    - removes NSIDC swath products MOD/MYD10_L2 and MOD/MYD29 from products list
    - discards LAADS products with empty folders (discussed in #123)


MODIS 1.2.6 (2022-08-30)

features and improvements

  * Enables the verification of Earthdata Login credentials against multiple
    servers, e.g. if one is not reachable (#124)


MODIS 1.2.5 (2022-08-26)

features and improvements

  * Extended list of supported MODIS products and collections (#118)

miscellaneous

  * Set sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE) for spherical geometry (#110)
  * Introduces further checks for valid Earthdata Login credentials (#111, #114)


MODIS 1.2.3

bug fixes

  * Explicitly format sf::st_drivers() name columns as 'character', which caused problems on systems running R ).

bug fixes

  * Curl-based download from LP DAAC.
  * "Error: object 'tid' not found" from climate modeling grids (CMG) not being identified as such, but treated as tiled products.
  * Wrong dimension and resolution of images created by runGdal() when working with whole tiles instead of spatial subsets (i.e. 'tileH,tileV' specified; see ).

miscellaneous

  * Code adjustments related to LAADS transition from FTP to HTTPS. In this context, lpdaacLogin() is now deprecated and has been replaced with EarthdataLogin() since both LP DAAC and LAADS require the specification of Earthdata Login credentials.
  * EarthdataLogin() now allows multiple entries in a .netrc file in case users have other servers not related to Earthdata.
  * Disabled retrieval of MOD16 products from NTSG server, which is no longer updated.
  * When 'extent' is a country name, 'outProj' is taken from MODISoptions() rather than hard-coded EPSG:4326.
  * If 'begin' falls in between two composite release dates, it is set back to start date of preceding release (see ).
  * When working with Extent (raster) or bbox objects (sf) and 'outProj' and 'pixelSize' are "asIn", the output grid and resolution is aligned with the original MODIS Sinusoidal grid.
  * Replaced 'XML' package dependency through regular expression matching.


MODIS 1.1.2

features and improvements

  * Added remaining products from the LP DAAC MODIS Products Table ().
  * Explicit specification of 'pos1','pos2' arguments passed to extractDate() and orgTime() is no longer required when dealing with standard MODIS file names.

bug fixes

  * 'unable to find an inherited method for function 'extent' for signature '"MODISextent"'' from getHdf() when 'extent' was a Spatial* object.
  * 'Error in rgdal::rawTransform(projfrom, projto, nrow(xy), xy[, 1], xy[, : no arguments in initialization list' due to insufficient strsplit() on Windows
  * Orphaned hole and self-intersection errors from getTile() due to some non-valid geometries in map("worldHires", ...) (eg. "Philippines", "Spain").
  * 'DATE' subfolder was created in getOption("MODIS_localArcPath") when running MODIS:::genString() with no particular date specified.

miscellaneous

  * Disabled use of EPSV (see ) when downloading structure from LP DAAC, LAADS. The latter didn't work anymore with EPSV enabled.
  * getProduct() and getCollection() are now compatible with more than one input 'product' provided using eg. c().
  * At the same time, pattern matching for a distinct set of products (see ) is switched off as long as a proper regular expression is omitted.
  * The MODIS package is now licensed under the MIT license ().


MODIS 1.1.0

features and improvements

  * getTile() now supports interactive tile selection from the MODIS Sinusoidal grid powered by mapedit ().
  * Creation of yearly composite layers has been made available through temporalComposite() and aggInterval().
  * Meaning of 'quiet' argument in MODISoptions() has changed and now determines whether getHdf() (or runGdal()) print download information to the console.

bug fixes

  * 'condition has length > 1' warning message from transDate() when specifying multiple 'begin' or 'end' dates.
  * 'no non-missing arguments to min (max); returning Inf' warning message from getTile() when 'x' was missing and 'tileH' or 'tileV' were specified as numeric.
  * ''begin' and 'end' dates seem to be confused, reordering dates...' warning message from aggInterval() when actual end date (ie end of current fortnightly/monthly time interval) lies in the future.
  * 'length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent' error in temporalComposite() when only one layer is available for a particular aggregation period.

miscellaneous

  * transDate() is now also compatible with true 'Date' objects.
  * Argument 'buffer' is no longer available for getTile(). As a result, rgeos could be removed from package imports.
  * getTile() does no longer support MERIS and SRTM data. As regards the latter, raster::getData(name = "SRTM", ...) could be used instead.
  * Further, getTile() is no longer compatible with 'list' input. In the course of this, argument 'extent' has been replaced by 'x' in order to avoid confusion with raster::extent().
  * temporalComposite() now relies on raster::calc() instead of raster::overlay(), which allows the specification of 'na.rm' separate from 'fun'.
  * aggInterval() does no longer take 'numeric' input (ie years).


MODIS 1.0.0

* Initial release
